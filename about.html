<h1 class="h1"> About Envision </h1>
<p> The Envision Council aims to influence tomorrowâ€™s world through the sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics, the arts, and a strong sense of character and leadership.</p> 
  <p>This organization differs from many similar endeavors because of the fact that it is student led. Our philosophy is that there are no individuals more suited to encourage the future leaders and innovaters of this world than heir peers.  </p>
<p> The council is built in four stages. The first stage is a test phase of hand-selected schools, so that we may gain reliable data and insight in regard to operating with this model. The second stage allows all schools in the United States to contribute a representative to the organization. The third stage pilots international expansion through another set of hand-selected schools, in similar fashion to stage one. The fourth stage allows all global schools to contribute to our council.</p>
<p> Students on the council will be divided into subcouncils based upon each student's main STEAM field of focus. Subcouncils are specialized groups based on the area of greatest interest (AGI) for the students in that subcouncil. Examples of these specialized groups include medicine, computer science, philosophy, and astronomy. To qualify for the Envision Council, students must be high school aged, with exceptions being made for only the most specific cases and with the approval of the board of directors.</p>
<p> Sub-council meetings are held weekly. A meeting with all members of the counsel will be conducted each month. To address the fact that all members of the council are located across a geographical area of about four million square miles, all weekly and monthly meetings will be held over a virtual platform. There is a plan to host a national conference once annually in person. </p>
<p> All research projects will be suggested, conducted, and presented by the students of the council. These projects will be voted upon at national meetings. Research will be done by the students using the resources they have at their disposal. As this council grows, we plan to offer grants for research.</p>
